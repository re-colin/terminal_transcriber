# whisper-queuer
A Python script for Whisper batch processing.

#### Setting up / Requirements
As of writing the bulk of this, the installation script in `run.bat` doesn't automatically handle dependencies for you besides doing a basic `pip install -r requirements.txt` call. Ideally Python would be the only thing the user needs to install manually.

#### Usage
Open `run.bat`, or run `main.py` directly.
